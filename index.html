Dragjs enhances the web possibilities given<br>
by the JSON serialization and OOP through<br>
the iconic rappresentation, eg. moving objects<br>
between scripts.<br><br>

Open the Dropjs page<br>two times and try the<br>
drag and drop feature from<br> one to the others:<br><br>

<input type="button" id="butOpenPages" onclick="openPages()" value="Open the required pages">

</div>

</body>
</html>
